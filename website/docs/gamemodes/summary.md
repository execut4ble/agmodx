Here you will find a summary of what every game mode does.

## Free For All 

This is the standard Deathmatch server.

## Team Deathmatch

This gamemode could vary from server to server. A fresh install set this to be the clanbase cup settings. The cup settings are accepted as the European standard.

## CTF

Capture The Flag mode, a fun teamplay mode where you try to capture the opponents flag.

## LMS

Last Man Standing wins!
You start with a subset of the standard weapons and battle it out until one man remains!

## LTS

Last Team Standing wins!
You start with a subset of the standard weapons and battle it out until one team remains!

## Arena

The one on one mode. When a player dies he goes to spectator mode and the next in line is spawned after a countdown. If you just want to watch you can change your ready status in the commandmenu (ready/notready). Settings may vary from server to server.

## Arcade

Warmup mode to get the feel for the weapons before a match. You allways spawn with all weapons and ammo. If you kill someone you get a refill as a reward. It got reduced headshot and less damage radius just like the match mode.

## Arcade X

Similar to Arcade, but instead you start with no armour, allowing for a more fast-paced gameplay.

## Sgbow

Shotgun and crossbow mode, this mode features a subset of the regular weapons and is alot of fun, it got reduced headshots and a gauss to jump with (gauss wont do any damage).

## Instagib

One shot one kill! You spawn equipped with a Crowbar and Gauss.
